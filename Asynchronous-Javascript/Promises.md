# Promises
- It is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future.
- 3 possible states:- pending, fulfilled and rejected
- Avoids callback hell
- Handles asynchronous operations
- When we create a promise, by default its a pending state
- finally() will execute after all the other processes are executed
